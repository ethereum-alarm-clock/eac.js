Javascript Commandline Tool
----------------------------

The EAC javascript cli is a simple tool to ease the use of the Alarm Clock
smart contracts. Right now, we use it as a tool for development. Here's how:

`node index -t` 
    sends a test transaction with an execution window that will begin
    in 20 blocks. Use this command to populate the test contracts with 
    upcoming requests for the client. (Only works if you're running a local node 
    on http://localhost:8545)

`node index -c`
    starts the client and logs info to the console. The client will scan
    the contracts for new transactionRequests every 4 seconds and attempt to 
    execute them every 5 seconds.
    (pass the `-m <ms>` option to change the number of milliseconds between scans)
    (pass the `-w <path to keystore> -p <password>` options to use the "send-from-many" light wallet functionality)

`node index -s`
    WIP - provides an interface to schedule a new transaction.


Creating a LightWallet
----------------------

You can use the eac commandline program to create a light wallet with 
a set of addresses that will be cycled through by the client. To do this
run the eac executable with the `--createWallet` flag. The client will then 
ask you for a few questions and create a new wallet file for you. The wallet 
file will be encrypted and saved onto your computer and you will need your 
password to decrypt it. 

```
$ eac --createWallet
How many accounts would you like in your wallet?
3
Where would you like to save the encrypted keys? Please provide a valid filename or path.
./keys
Please enter a password for the keyfile. Write this down!
<your password>
New wallet created!
Accounts:
0x79E944aA5c44C1dA75e30313682bd506A80F2115
0x838378b72b022551F0Ef49b1dA9eFCCF1A1D7294
0x4b7CE6c8d193E31d22C620BcDf8d3590fe2f99C2
Saving encrypted file to ./keys. Don't forget your password!
```

Now next time you start eac you can start it like so to activate wallet support!

```
$ eac -c --wallet ./keys --password <your password>
```

However, before you do this for real you will want to fund each of your accounts
with enough ether to enable them to claim and execute transactions. A good number 
is at least 1 ether for each account. You can do this manually, or you can use 
the script provided in `script/wallet/2_fundWallet.js`. If you change your 
mind about running an EAC server, you can always send the ether back to
your main account. Use the script at `script/wallet/3_testWallet.js` to 
drain all of your wallet accounts of their ether.

***NOTE***
Only use these scripts if you understand what they are doing. The lightwallet 
support is still considered alpha status until we can figure out how to 
better streamline the user experience.
***END NOTE***

After you have funded your children account and you begin running the client you
will see a friendly message stating that you are now running with wallet support 
enabled! Enjoy executing transactions 🙂
